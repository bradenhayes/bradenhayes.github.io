                            Pis.
                            Braden's Python skills were put to use as the bulk of this project was written in python.
                            Utilizing multiple API keys writing the sensor data to Matlab's ThingSpeak and
                            reading
                            it on the server Raspberry Pi and writing .MP3 files to Dropbox and reading them from the
                            server Raspberry Pi.

                        Using Spotify's "Spotify for Developers" every friday when the Release
                        Radar playlist made by Spotify is refreshed this
                        Python script creates a new playlist named the current date (ex. 2021-01-01). It will then
                        copy every song from the Release Radar playlist
                        into an array which will then put all of those songs into the newly created playlist. In
                        addition to this,
                        it will automatically play this playlist
                        if the user wishes.

                    </p>
                    <p class="Description">
                        The reason the was made is because release radar always updates weekly losing the playlist
                        from
                        the previous week.
                        Now, the playlist will be saved to your Spotify playlists and you will always have access to
                        it.
